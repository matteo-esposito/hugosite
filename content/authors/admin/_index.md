I'm an undergrad currently studying actuarial mathematics and computer science. I have experience in insurance, working in actuarial and data science focused teams, acquired in my co-op internships during my bachelors.

I love running, all things tech and am a passionate python programmer. 

Currently looking to pursue a MSc in computer science with a data science/machine learning focus.
