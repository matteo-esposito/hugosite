Welcome! 

My name is Matteo and I'm a masters student at the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms at the University of Montreal. My professional experience is mainly in the insurance industry, where I worked in actuarial and data science focused teams during my co-op internships as part of my bachelors.

I love running and cycling (see my Strava above), all things tech and am a passionate python programmer always looking to sharpen my skills.
